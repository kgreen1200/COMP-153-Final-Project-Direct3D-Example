# COMP 153 Final Project Direct 3D Example
This is the group example for the final project in COMP 153 - Computer Graphics Fall 2020. This project is used in the production of the final paper and the final presentation for the course, serving as an example on how to create a simple scene using DirectX/Direct3D.

This is a Visual Studio Project that models and renders a spinning pyramid onto the scene. The pyramid itself spins around in order to demonstrate how the light changes as the object moves.
This project was built using DirectX 11, meaning that this project is compatiable with the following operating systems:
* Windows Vista
* Windows 7
* Windows 8
* Windows 10
